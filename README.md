## 📘 What This Repository Represents

This repo isn’t just code — it’s a timeline of my *learning growth*:
- From writing my first hello_world.c to structuring OOP code in C++
- From creating static HTML pages to experimenting with JavaScript interactivity
- From solving logical problems in Python to connecting pieces across languages

Each folder is a *checkpoint* in my progress as I continue to learn, build, and refine my skills.
